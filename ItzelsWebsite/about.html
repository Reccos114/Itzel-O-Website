    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p class="AParagraph"> 
        Hi! I’m Itzel Ortiz, and I began my journey in real estate and property management with Rent Appeal in 2022. 
        What started as a new opportunity quickly became a true passion. I’ve grown to love the dynamic nature of the 
        industry especially the connections I get to make with both customers and investors. I take pride in delivering 
        exceptional service and building strong, lasting relationships. As continue to grow professionally, I’m committed 
        to expanding my knowledge and exploring all areas of real estate. From property management and tenant relations to 
        marketing and listings, I’m always eager to take on new challenges and contribute meaningfully to the teams I work with.
